                    <h2>Web</h2>
                    <p>I like to think of myself as the lynchpin of the internet. Obviously, that isn't truth but it strokes my ego. On the web I am ninja-cool with HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. Javascript has been my main focus for the last few years. Crockford is like a grandfather to me based on how much of his stuff I have read and utilized.</p>
                    <p>At my present place of work, I have been tasked with building and maintaining two separate Javascript libraries. Each library has multiple developers and thousands of users. Due to NDA's I can't speak to details, but each libray has a lot of features. So that leads me to the list of web things I do, know and love.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>HTML5</strong> - Local Storage, Web Workerz, Media, Drag and Drop</li>
                        <li><strong>CSS3</strong> - Transforms, Translate, Gradients, etc...</li>
                        <li><strong>Knockout.js</strong> - templates, custom bindings, Pager.js plugin</li>
                        <li><strong>jQuery</strong> - AJAX, promises, Mobile, plugin development</li>
                    </ul>

                <section class="server">
                    <h2>Server</h2>
                    <p>Web Applications don't run without a server to serve and host them. With a background in IT, I have learned to love the set up as much as the end product. I have been hosting and managing our company's deployment and web servers. This includes scripting deployment, file management, user management, database setup and mangement.</p>
                    <p>I live in my terminal. In fact, I am almost evangelistic about using the terminal. So, I'm quite comfortable with logging into remote servers and managing them.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>python - tornado, django, flask</li>
                        <li>node.js - express, mongoose</li>
                        <li>database - MySQL, postgreSQL, mongodb, T-SQL</li>
                        <li>Distros - CentOS, Ubuntu</li>
                        <li>Web Servers - Apache, Lighttp, Nginx, Uwsgi</li>
                        <li>Shells - zsh, bash</li>
                        <li>AWS - S3, EC2, Cloudfront</li>

                <section class="process">
                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <p>One thing that really drives my love for the terminal and my experience with server-side technologies is my love for process streamlining. I tell many people around me that I am not the fastest typer, kind of slow actually, but, I have all of my keyboard shortcuts set up and memorized. I like to think that I maximize my personal efficiency. Part of my obsession with efficiency requires me to make tools that the rest of my team can use as well.</p>
                    <p>It is only because of my aversion to doing things twice that I have a toolbelt of scripts that make my life easier and maximize efficiency for the whole team.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>VCS - Git, SVN, Github</li>
